#Visualizing bootstrap samples

#you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.

#example - you will compute a bootstrap estimate of the probability density function of the mean annual rainfall at the Sheffield Weather Station. 
# Remember, we are estimating the mean annual rainfall we would get if the Sheffield Weather Station could repeat all of the measurements from 1883 to 2015 over and over again.
# This is a probabilistic estimate of the mean. 
# plot the PDF as a histogram, and you will see that it is Normal.
