#permutation sampling is a great way to simulate the hypothesis that two variables have identical probability distributions.

#write a function to generate a permutation sample from two data sets.

#Concatenate the two input arrays into one using np.concatenate(). 
#Be sure to pass in data1 and data2 as one argument (data1, data2).

#Use np.random.permutation() to permute the concatenated array.

def permutation_sample(data1, data2):
    """Generate a permutation sample from two data sets."""

    # Concatenate the data sets: data
    data = np.concatenate((data1,data2))

    # Permute the concatenated array: permuted_data
    permuted_data = np.random.permutation(data)

    # Split the permuted array into two: perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2
    perm_sample_1 = permuted_data[:len(data1)]
    perm_sample_2 = permuted_data[len(data1):]

#Visualizing permutation sampling

#use the Sheffield Weather Station data again, this time considering the monthly rainfall in June (a dry month) and November (a wet month). 
#We expect these might be differently distributed, 
#so we will take permutation samples to see how their ECDFs would look if they were identically distributed.


#Write a for loop to generate 50 permutation samples, compute their ECDFs, and plot them
#Generate a permutation sample pair from rain_june and rain_november using your permutation_sample() function.
#Generate the x and y values for an ECDF for each of the two permutation samples for the ECDF using your ecdf() function.

for _ in range(50):
    # Generate permutation samples
    perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(rain_june, rain_november)


    # Compute ECDFs
    x_1, y_1 = ecdf(perm_sample_1)
    x_2, y_2 = ecdf(perm_sample_2)

    # Plot ECDFs of permutation sample
    _ = plt.plot(x_1,y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='red', alpha=0.02)
    _ = plt.plot(x_2,y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='blue', alpha=0.02)

# Create and plot ECDFs from original data
x_1, y_1 = ecdf(rain_june)
x_2, y_2 = ecdf(rain_november)
_ = plt.plot(x_1, y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='red')
_ = plt.plot(x_2, y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none', color='blue')

# Label axes, set margin, and show plot
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('monthly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()


#interpretation: None of the ECDFs from the permutation samples overlap with the observed data, 
#suggesting that the hypothesis is not commensurate with the data. June and November rainfall are not identically distributed.



#example 1 Generating permutation replicates

#Define a function with this signature: draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1).
#Initialize an array to hold the permutation replicates using np.empty()
#Write a for loop to:
#Compute a permutation sample using your permutation_sample() function
#Pass the samples into func() to compute the replicate and store the result in your array of replicates.

def draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1):
    """Generate multiple permutation replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
    perm_replicates = np.empty(size)

    for i in range(size):
        # Generate permutation sample
        perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(data_1, data_2)

        # Compute the test statistic
        perm_replicates[i] = func( perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2)

    return perm_replicates
