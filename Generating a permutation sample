#permutation sampling is a great way to simulate the hypothesis that two variables have identical probability distributions.

#write a function to generate a permutation sample from two data sets.

#Concatenate the two input arrays into one using np.concatenate(). 
#Be sure to pass in data1 and data2 as one argument (data1, data2).

#Use np.random.permutation() to permute the concatenated array.

    # Split the permuted array into two: perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2

#Visualizing permutation sampling

#use the Sheffield Weather Station data again, this time considering the monthly rainfall in June (a dry month) and November (a wet month). 
#We expect these might be differently distributed, 
#so we will take permutation samples to see how their ECDFs would look if they were identically distributed.


#Write a for loop to generate 50 permutation samples, compute their ECDFs, and plot them
#Generate a permutation sample pair from rain_june and rain_november using your permutation_sample() function.
#Generate the x and y values for an ECDF for each of the two permutation samples for the ECDF using your ecdf() function.

for _ in range(50):
    # Generate permutation samples
    perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(rain_june, rain_november)


    # Compute ECDFs
    x_1, y_1 = ecdf(perm_sample_1)
    x_2, y_2 = ecdf(perm_sample_2)

    # Plot ECDFs of permutation sample
    _ = plt.plot(x_1,y_1, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='red', alpha=0.02)
    _ = plt.plot(x_2,y_2, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='blue', alpha=0.02)

# Create and plot ECDFs from original data
x_1, y_1 = ecdf(rain_june)
x_2, y_2 = ecdf(rain_november)

# Label axes, set margin, and show plot
plt.margins(0.02)

_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.show()


#interpretation: None of the ECDFs from the permutation samples overlap with the observed data, 
#suggesting that the hypothesis is not commensurate with the data. June and November rainfall are not identically distributed.
